                Vissa nätter blir en individ märkt av Urdstämman, något som ofta leder till förlusten av deras sinne och
                slutligen liv, men vissa lyckas överleva
                denna prövning och kliver ur den starkare än någonsin. Dessa individer kallas för <i>häxor</i>, och i
                många byar anses deras närvaro vara ett dåligt omen.
                <br>
                I verklighet är häxor ofta brutna invidier, utstötta från samhället och plågade av visioner från
                Urdstämman. Många väljer livet av äventyr, sökandes efter en
                plats att kalla hem eller svar på Urdstämmans gåtor.

                At 1st level, you have been marked by one of the Urdvoices, turning you into a witch. Your choice grants
                you features at 1st, 3rd, 10th, and 15th level.
                <br>
                You choose between the following three options (witches bearing other marks exist in the world, but are

            <!-- Hexes-->
            <div class="breadText" style="text-align: left;">
                <div class="subHead2">Hexes</div>
                Also at 1st level you learn two Hexes. These represent the unique and bizarre magic of the Urdvoices.
                Consult the Hexes Known table to see when you learn additional ones.
                Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can change one learned Hex for another.
                Each Hex will detail how it's used - action, bonus action, time-based, etc - and how many times you can use
                them. You can only use one Hex per turn.
                <br><br>
                When you first start this class, choose Wisdom or Intelligence. This becomes your Witch Ability Score,
                and your Witch Modifier is that ability scores modifier.
                Many features in the Witch class will force creatures to make saving throws,
                when they do so, you use your Witch Save DC, which is calculated as follows:
                <br>
                <span class="textHighlight">Witch Save DC:</span> 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Witch Modifier

                Starting at 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the
                following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to
                choose again.
                <ul>

                        you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range,
                        unless the creature successfully hides from you.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        They count as witch spells for you, and your Witch Ability Score is your spellcasting ability
                        for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with
                        another cantrip from the wizard spell list.

                        <span class="textHighlight">Dueling.</span> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and

            <!-- Spellcasting -->
            <div class="breadText" style="text-align: left;">
                <div class="subHead2">Spellcasting</div>
                By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on arcane magic through your mark, allowing you to cast spells
                like those with a patron.

                <div class="textHighlightHeading">
                    Preparing and Casting Spells
                </div>
                The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your witch spells. To cast one of your witch
                spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
                expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
                <br><br>
                You prepare the list of witch spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <span
                    class="textHighlight"><a href="witchClass-spells.html"> witch spell list</a></span>. When you do so,
                choose a number of witch spells equal to your Witch modifier + half your witch level, rounded down
                (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
                <br><br>
                For example, if you are a 5th-level witch, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a
                Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
                combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a
                2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
                <br><br>
                You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of witch
                spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on
                your list.
                <div class="textHighlightHeading">
                    Spellcasting Ability
                </div>
                Your Witch ability score (Intelligence or Wisdom) is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells,
                since their power derives from various worldly sources.
                You use your Witch ability score whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
                In addition, you use your Witch modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and
                when making an attack roll with one.
                <br>
                <span class="textHighlight">Spell save DC = </span>8 + your proficiency bonus + your Witch modifier

                    Ritual Casting
                </div>
                You can cast a witch spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
                <br>
                <div class="textHighlightHeading">
                    Spellcasting Focus
                </div>
                You use a Witches trinket or a component pouch as a spellcasting focus for your Witch spells. A Witches
                trinket can be anything important to your Mark.
                For example, a Witch of Skarn could carry a prayerbook that once belonged to a warrior priest while a
                Witch of Gård could carry a reliquary made in gold from the old world.

                Also at 2nd level you learn a Ritual. These are powerful passive abilities unique to the witches of
                Vallone.
                Consult the Rituals Known column to see when you learn additional ones.
                Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can change one learned Ritual for another.
                Rituals are powerful passive abilities that also bring with them downsides. At the end of every long
                rest you apply any amount of Rituals you know to you.
                <br>
                Every Ritual has an Effect, Curse and Activation section. The effect is its passive ability, curse the
                downside, and activation is a powerful one time effect. After an activation, the Ritual effect ends
                until it is applied
                again.

                score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
                can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
                Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

                When you reach 6th level you can create Shrines to the Urdvoices, giving you a closer connection to the
                land. Whenever you complete a Long Rest you can create a small shrine dedicated to the god that marked
                you.
                Afterwards, whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest within 100 ft. of this Shrine you gain the

                At 7th level you learn a powerful curse unique to witches: The Urd Malison, a manifestation of you the
                Urdvoices. Once per Long Rest you can
                activate your Urd Malison as an Action, distorting your visage and creating an aura of eldritch energy extending 10 ft. out from
                you. The Malison lasts for 1 minute or until you become incapacitated, during which you have the
                following effects:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Whenever a creature starts it turn within the aura you can force them to make a Wisdom saving
                        throw. On a failure they are frightened until the end of their turn.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whenever you hit a creature inside the aura with a weapon attack, it deals an additional
                        necrotic damage equal to your Witch Modifier.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your movement speed is increased by 10 ft., and hostile creatures within the aura have theirs reduced by
                        10 ft..
                    </li>
                </ul>
                At 11th and 14th level you get an additional use of this ability per Long Rest.

                At 18th level, your Rituals are such second nature that you can swiftly apply them. Whenever you
                complete a Short Rest you can apply any amount of Rituals you know.

            </div>
            The witches of the Wastelands are as feared as they are revered. While many accept that they can do good,
            the presence of the Urdvoices can be enough to make others uneasy. Some witches are marked while they are
            young, seemingly inexplicably, while others commit some deed which grants them their mark. Think of how your
            character got their mark, what they feel about it and the connected deity, as well as how the deity
            influences their personality.
