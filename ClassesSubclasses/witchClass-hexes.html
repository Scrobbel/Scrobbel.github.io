            </div>
            This document is intentionally vague on what each Hex looks like when you use it. You may choose what it
            appears as, usually a Hex is deeply personal to the witch and reflecting of the Mark they bear.

        <!-- Steal Time -->
        <div class="breadText" style="text-align: left;">
            <div class="subHead2" style="text-align: left;">
                Steal Time
            </div>
            <i>You steal time from a creature, slowing down the target while increasing your abilities.</i>
            <br>
            <b>Prerequisite: 5th level, Witch of GÃ¥rd</b>
            <br>
            As a bonus action, target creature you can see within 30 ft. of you gains a -2 to their AC, can't use
            reactions, and has its speed halved.
            Conversely, you gain a +2 to your AC and your speed is doubled. This effect lasts until the start of
            your
            turn.
            When you reach 11th level you can target an additional creature to be slowed. This does not affect your
            stat
            increases.
            <br>
            You can use this an amount of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus per long rest.

        <!-- Twisted Smite -->
        <div class="breadText" style="text-align: left;">
            <div class="subHead2" style="text-align: left;">
                Twisted Smite
            </div>
            <i>You strike a creature with sacrilegious might, cursing them for a short duration.</i>
            <br>
            When you hit a creature with a weapon attack you can expend a spell slot of any level. The attack an
            additional 1d6 necrotic damage per level of the spell slot.
            Distorted energy then surrounds the creature. They are under the effects of the <i>Bane</i> spell until
            the end of their next turn.

        <!-- Broken Wings -->
        <div class="breadText" style="text-align: left;">
            <div class="subHead2" style="text-align: left;">
                Broken Wings
            </div>
            <i>You touch a creature and sprout corrupted wings from your back, granting them power of flight for a short while.</i>
            <br>
            As an action you touch a creature and give it a Flight speed of 30 ft. for 1 minute. You can do this
            twice per long rest and must concentrate on the flying as if it were a spell.
        </div>
        <br>
        <!-- Inflict Nightmares -->
        <div class="breadText" style="text-align: left;">
            <div class="subHead2" style="text-align: left;">
                Inflict Nightmares
            </div>
            <i>You inflict terrible nightmares on a creature, preventing them from resting.</i>
            <br>
            Once per long rest, you choose one creature you have either talked to or touched within the last 24
            hours.
            Alternatively, if you have a physical connection to it (body part, piece of hair, bit of nail etc) you
            can
            do it regardless of when you've interacted with them. The physical connection turns to ash after it has
            been
            used.
            The target must make a Wisdom saving throw - with disadvantage if you used a physical connection -, on a
            failure they are cursed with nightmares of your choice. The next time the target takes a long rest they
            gain
            a point of exhaustion as well as no benefits from the rest.
            Regardless of if the target fails or not, they are unaware they had to make a saving throw.

            <br>
            As an action, choose up to three creatures you can see within 30 ft. and then expend a spell slot.
            All chosen creatures heal an amount equal to you Witch Modifier per spell slot level expended.
            This Hex has no effect on a deafened or unconscious creature.
            You can use this Hex twice per long rest.

                Punish Weakness
            </div>
            <i>You capitalize on a moment of weakness, cursing your enemy.</i>
            <br>
            Whenever a creature you can see within 60 ft. of you fails a saving throw, you can use your reaction to
            deal
            1d8 psychic damage to them.
            At 11th level, this increases to 2d8.

            <i>You draw upon the power of the Deep Woods to send someone a message.</i>
            <br>
            <b>Prerequisite: 5th level</b>
            <br>
            As an action you can expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to send a message to a creature through
            the Deep Woods. The message can be no longer than 25 words and must be spoken by you.
            If the creature is within 2 kilometers of a Deep Woods entrance a plant will sprout near them to deliver
            the message. If they are not in range when you use this Hex, if they enter
            the 2 kilometer range within 24 hours a plant sprouts to deliver the message.

                flame.</i>
            <br>
            <b>Prerequisite: 5th level, Witch of Skarn</b>
            <br>
            When taking the Attack action while holding a firearm you may make one attack with Anathema Gunpowder. You
            shoot at a point within the firearms range. All creatures within 5 ft. of that point must make a Dexterity
            saving throw.
            On a failure they take 5d6 fire damage, or half as much on a success. You can use this Hex once per short
            rest.
