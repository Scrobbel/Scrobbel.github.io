        <div class="breadText" style="text-align: left;">
            <div class="subHead2" style="text-align: left;">
                Steal Time
            </div>
            <i>You steal time from a creature, slowing down the target while increasing your abilities.</i>
            <br>
            <b>Prerequisite: 5th level, Witch of Gård</b>
            <br>
            As a bonus action, target creature you can see within 30 ft. of you gains a -2 to their AC, can't use
            reactions, and has its speed halved.
            Conversely, you gain a +2 to your AC and your speed is doubled. This effect lasts until the start of your
            turn.
            When you reach 11th level you can target an additional creature to be slowed. This does not affect your stat
            increases.
            <br>
            You can use this an amount of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus per long rest.

                Twisted Smite
            </div>
            <i>You strike a creature with sacrilegious might, cursing them for a short duration.</i>
            <br>
            When you hit a creature with a weapon attack you can expend a spell slot of any level. The attack an
            additional 1d6 necrotic damage per level of the spell slot.
            Distorted energy then surrounds the creature. They are under the effects of the <i>Bane</i> spell until the
            end of their next turn.

        <!-- Broken Wings -->
        <div class="breadText" style="text-align: left;">
            <div class="subHead2" style="text-align: left;">
                Broken Wings
            </div>
            <i>You touch a creature and sprout corrupted wings from your back, granting them power of flight for a short
                while.</i>
            <br>
            As an action you touch a creature and give it a Flight speed of 30 ft. for 1 minute. You can do this twice
            per long rest and must concentrate on the flying as if it were a spell.
        </div>

        <!-- Inflict Nightmares -->
        <div class="breadText" style="text-align: left;">

            </div>
            <i>You inflict terrible nightmares on a creature, preventing them from resting.</i>
            <br>
            Once per long rest, you choose one creature you have either talked to or touched within the last 24 hours. 
            Alternatively, if you have a physical connection to it (body part, piece of hair, bit of nail etc) you can do it regardless of when you've interacted with them. The physical connection turns to ash after it has been used.
            The target must make a Wisdom saving throw - with disadvantage if you used a physical connection -, on a failure they are cursed with nightmares of your choice. The next time the target takes a long rest they gain a point of exhaustion as well as no benefits from the rest.
            Regardless of if the target fails or not, they are unaware they had to make a saving throw.
